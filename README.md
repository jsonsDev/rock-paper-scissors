# rock-paper-scissors

This was my submission for The Odin Project's [Rock Paper Scissors project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

It was a great problem solving exercise that allowed me to gain a better understanding of the previous JavaScript lessons from the course.

I felt motivated reaching "ah-ha" moments and seeing my game take shape.

Onward!
